# This is a placeholder whose code you'll replace:
00 read r1          # get # from user to r1
01 setn r2 1        # r2 =1
02 setn r4 0        # r3 = 0
03 jeqzn r1 11      # if r1 = 0 jump to line 9
04 nop
05 write r2         # print r2
06 add r3 r2 r4     # r3 = r2 + r4
07 copy r2 r3       # r2 = r3   
08 sub r4 r3 r4     # r4 = r3 - r4
09 addn r1 -1       # r1 = r1 - 1
10 jumpn 3          # jump to line 1
11 halt             # stop.
