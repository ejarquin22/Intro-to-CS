The first diasadvantage of subroutines no longer exists today because of the high speeds
at which mondern-day computers are able to function. The second disadvantage no longer matters either since
monder programming no longer requires the need to program subroutines everytime youd need to use one. One 
advantage that Hopper does not mention is that modner programs like python allow you to creats loops that call on functions
as many times as you want without having to create the program again.

requires a lack of consiousness.
